# Air Quality Analysis Project

This project is designed to analyze air quality data and provide insights using machine learning models and graphical user interfaces.

## Project Structure

- **`air_quality_model.pkl`**: Pre-trained machine learning model for air quality prediction.
- **`gui2.py`**: Python script for the graphical user interface to interact with the air quality model.
- **`sppu_pune.csv`**: CSV file containing air quality data for SPPU Pune.
- **`vimannagar.csv`**: CSV file containing air quality data for Vimannagar.
- **`tut1.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for tutorial or exploratory data analysis.
